## Scope

DAP Database focuses on dedicated audiophile and hi-res digital audio players. General consumer MP3 players, smartphones, and audio-focused phones are out of scope unless separate categories are added later.

## Features

- Browse DAPs in card view or table view.
- Search by brand, model, variant, DAC, SoC, OS, or colors.
- Filter by brand, status, source quality, Android-based devices, 4.4mm output, price, year, audio features, and connectivity.
- Open linkable detail views with specs, source links, review links, notes, and photos.
- Request missing DAPs or report corrections through GitHub issues.

## Data

The editable source of truth is `src/data/daps.csv`.

The app reads generated data from `src/data/daps.json`.

After editing the CSV, run:

```bash
npm run generate:data
```

Commit both `src/data/daps.csv` and `src/data/daps.json` so GitHub Pages builds predictably.

For detailed CSV fields, review-link handling, buying-link fields, and image workflow, see [docs/data-workflow.md](docs/data-workflow.md).

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run generate:data
npm run dev
```

Build and preview:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

The Vite base path is configured as `/dap-database/`.

The included GitHub Actions workflow builds on pushes to `main`, generates JSON from CSV, and deploys `dist` using GitHub Pages Actions.

## Accuracy

Specs are best-effort and source-backed where possible. Values may vary by region, firmware, revision, gain setting, output mode, or measurement method.

AI tools may assist with research, extraction, normalization, and draft notes. Entries are reviewed before being added, but mistakes can still happen. Please report corrections with a source link.

Some buying links may be affiliate links. I may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. Specs, reviews, and sources stay separate.

See [docs/source-data-notes.md](docs/source-data-notes.md) for verification labels, source rules, review-link separation, review-site credits, buying-link separation, and affiliate-link notes.
