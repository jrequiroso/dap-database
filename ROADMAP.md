# DAP Database Roadmap

This roadmap tracks source-backed DAP model additions planned for the public DAP Database. It is intentionally prioritized instead of being a complete wish list.

The database source of truth is `src/data/daps.csv`; `src/data/daps.json` is generated from it. Do not use this roadmap as a list of existing rows. Before adding any model, check the CSV first to avoid duplicates.

Only keep model names here when there is a reasonable public-source trail that the model exists as a standalone digital audio player. If a candidate cannot be verified, leave it out until a source is found.

## Scope

Include standalone digital audio players that can play local music files or streaming audio without requiring a phone, computer, or separate host device.

Do not add rows for:

- USB dongle DAC/amps
- desktop DACs or amps
- Bluetooth receivers without standalone playback
- accessories, docks, cables, or modules by themselves
- smartphones or audio-focused phones
- general consumer MP3 players such as iPod, Zune, Sansa, Creative Zen, and older mass-market flash/HDD players
- color-only, bundle-only, or storage-only variants unless the model identity depends on that variant

Scope note:

The database focuses on dedicated audiophile and hi-res digital audio players.

Audio-focused phones such as the Moondrop MIAD 01 and general consumer MP3 players such as iPod, Zune, Sansa, and Creative Zen are currently out of scope. They may be reconsidered only if the project later adds separate audio-phone or classic media-player categories.

## Current Data Status

As of 2026-07-13, `src/data/daps.csv` contains 236 source-backed DAP rows, and every row has a local optimized image referenced through `image_filename`.

Latest local checks:

- `npm run generate:data`
- `npm run build`

## Source Rules

Official sources are preferred.

Source priority:

1. Official product page
2. Official manual / support page
3. Official store page
4. Archived official page
5. Trusted review site
6. Reputable retailer
7. Community source

If official sources are unavailable, add the row only when at least two reliable secondary sources agree on the core specs.

If only one secondary source is available, the row may be added as Partial or Unverified, with uncertain fields left blank.

Do not guess specs from memory.

Digital transport DAPs are in scope when they are standalone portable library players, but they must be clearly identified in Notes. Do not mark digital-output jacks as analog headphone outputs, and leave DAC, amp, and analog power fields blank unless an internal analog stage is verified.

## Review Link Rules

Review links are optional and separate from spec sources.

Currently accepted review-link sources:

- Headfonics
- Headfonia
- Twister6
- What Hi-Fi

Rules:

- Use exact model or exact variant matches only.
- Do not use review links as proof for unrelated specs unless the review is also named in Notes as a secondary source.
- Keep review links out of source, buy, and affiliate fields.
- Use `Label|URL; Label|URL` format.

## Variant Rules

Separate variant rows should be added only when the variant has meaningful hardware or spec differences.

Add a separate row when the variant changes:

- DAC
- amp section
- output ports
- operating system/platform
- battery
- RAM/storage configuration, if it affects the model identity
- wireless/cellular configuration
- decoding support
- modular amp/DAC configuration

Do not add a separate row just for:

- color variants
- chassis material, finish, or weight-only variants with the same core audio platform
- storage-only variants
- regional naming
- bundle/package differences
- limited editions with the same internals

When unsure, add the base model first and note possible variants for later review.

## Alias Notes

Some DAPs are commonly searched using shorthand, alternate spacing, generation names, or regional names.

Long term, the CSV should include a dedicated aliases column so search can match these terms without creating duplicate rows.

Until an aliases column exists, aliases may be documented in Notes, but they should not create duplicate model rows.

## Priority 1: Add by Request or When Sources Are Easy

These fit the broader DAP scope, but they should not block launch or higher-priority historical gaps.

### HiFiMAN

- HIFIMAN HM-801
- HIFIMAN HM-802
- HIFIMAN HM-901
- HIFIMAN HM901R
- HIFIMAN HM1000
- HIFIMAN HM-700
- HIFIMAN R2R2000
- HiFiMAN SuperMini
- HiFiMAN MegaMini

Naming note:

Confirm whether hyphenated and non-hyphenated names are aliases before adding. Do not create separate duplicate rows for `HM901` and `HM-901` unless sources prove different products.

### xDuoo

- xDuoo X2
- xDuoo X2S
- xDuoo X3
- xDuoo X3 II
- xDuoo X5
- xDuoo X10
- xDuoo X20
- xDuoo Nano D3


### QLS / Quloos

- QLS QA661
- QLS QA662
- QLS QA390
- QLS QA390LE / MOD / QA390V2
- QLS QA860

Variant note:

Investigate QA390LE, QA390 MOD, and QA390V2 before adding rows. QLS groups these names closely, so confirm whether each has meaningful hardware/spec differences or should be represented as one row with aliases/notes.

### Other Modern / Relevant DAPs

- Colorfly C4
- Colorfly U8
- Colorfly U6
- ONIX Overture XM5
- ONIX Waltz XM10 LTD
- Oriolus DPS-L2
- YinLvMei W1s
- F.AUDIO FA4

Scope note:

Some Colorfly, TempoTec, ONIX, Oriolus, YinLvMei, and F.AUDIO models may need extra source checking because product categories can blur the line between standalone DAPs, transports, and desktop/portable source devices.

TempoTec V3 Blaze appears to overlap with existing `V3` coverage unless sources prove meaningful hardware/spec differences. Do not add bundle rows such as V3 Blaze+IM01 unless the DAP itself differs.

### Budget / AliExpress-Style DAPs

- Ruizu A55
- Ruizu A58
- Ruizu X02
- Ruizu X50
- Benjie S5
- Benjie K9
- AGPTEK H3
- AGPTEK H50
- AGPTEK A02
- Mechen M30
- Mechen M31
- Mechen M3

Variant note:

Budget DAPs often have inconsistent listings, relabels, and silent revisions. Add only when sources are clear enough. Avoid duplicate rows for obvious rebrands unless there is enough evidence that they are sold as meaningfully different models.
