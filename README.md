## Goals

- Make DAP specs easier to compare.
- Keep sources visible.
- Separate official, official screenshot, review, retail, and web-verified data.
- Keep spec sources, review links, and buy links separate.
- Avoid unsourced claims where possible.
- Keep the project static and easy to host on GitHub Pages.

## Current MVP Features

- Browse the DAP catalog in card view.
- Search by brand, model, variant, DAC, SoC, OS, or colors.
- Filter by brand, status, source quality, Android-based devices, 4.4mm output, price, year, audio features, and connectivity.
- Sort by brand, model, release year, MSRP, battery, SE power, and balanced power.
- Open linkable detail modals for each DAP.
- View official product links, source links, and notes when available.
- View color variants when available.
- Local product image support.
- Mobile-friendly card view and optional power-user table view.

## Verification Status Meanings

- Verified - Official: confirmed from an official brand page.
- Verified - Official Screenshot: confirmed from an official brand screenshot or official spec image.
- Verified - Review: confirmed from a reliable review.
- Verified - Retail/Web: confirmed from retailer or public spec listing.
- Verified - Web: confirmed from general web source.
- Partial: source exists, but specs are incomplete.
- Partial - Official: official page exists, but full specs are not readable.
- Needs Source: source still missing.

## Source/data notes

"Rows with sources" means each row has at least one source link. Verification quality may still vary by model. Official, Review, Web, Partial, and Unverified labels indicate source confidence.

Specs are best-effort and source-backed where possible. Values may vary by region, firmware, revision, gain setting, output mode, or measurement method.

Some buying links may be affiliate links. I may earn a small commission if you buy through them, at no extra cost to you. Specs, review links, and source references are kept separate from affiliate links.

See [docs/source-data-notes.md](docs/source-data-notes.md) for source, review, buy-link, and affiliate-link separation notes.

## Data Workflow

- Edit `src/data/daps.csv`.
- Run `npm run generate:data`.
- This creates `src/data/daps.json`.
- The app reads `src/data/daps.json`.
- Commit both CSV and JSON so GitHub Pages builds predictably.

## Data Location

The editable source is `src/data/daps.csv`. Generated application data is `src/data/daps.json`.

Optional buying-link CSV fields are supported but intentionally blank unless populated manually:

- `official_store_url`
- `buy_links`
- `affiliate_links`
- `buy_notes`

Buying links use this format:

```text
Label|URL; Label|URL
```

Do not use buy links or affiliate links as spec sources.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run generate:data
npm run dev
```

Build and preview:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Updating the Database

1. Edit `src/data/daps.csv`.
2. Keep source links and notes visible and specific.
3. Run `npm run generate:data`.
4. Check the generated summary for verification and source counts.
5. Commit both `src/data/daps.csv` and `src/data/daps.json`.

## Media and Image Usage

- Image fields are optional.
- Do not hotlink random review images.
- Prefer official product image URLs, user-owned photos, or images with clear permission.
- Product images remain owned by their respective brands, manufacturers, retailers, reviewers, or original sources.
- Color variants can be added using the Colors column in CSV.
- Colors should use slash-separated values like `Black / Silver / Green`.

## Safe Image Workflow

Do not scrape Google Images or random websites. Use official product photos from brand pages, press kits, official stores, user-owned photos, or images with explicit permission.

Supported optional CSV image fields:

- `image_filename`
- `image_url`
- `image_source_url`
- `image_credit`
- `color_variants`

Existing title-case image columns are also still supported for compatibility:

- `Image URL`
- `Image Source URL`
- `Image Credit`
- `Colors`

Image display priority:

1. If `image_filename` exists, the app loads `/assets/images/daps/{image_filename}`.
2. If `image_filename` is blank but `image_url` exists, the app uses `image_url` as a fallback.
3. If neither exists, the app shows a clean placeholder.

Local image rules:

- Store original downloaded files in `public/assets/images/daps-original/`.
- Store optimized WebP files in `public/assets/images/daps/`.
- Use lowercase kebab-case filenames.
- Use `.webp` for optimized output.
- Recommended filename format: `brand-model-variant-color.webp`.
- Examples:
  - `fiio-jm21-refresh-blue.webp`
  - `hiby-r4-green.webp`
  - `astell-kern-a-norma-sr35-silver.webp`
  - `shanling-m3-ultra-black.webp`

Manual workflow:

1. Find an official product photo from a brand page, press kit, or official store.
2. Save the source URL in `image_source_url`.
3. Save the credit in `image_credit`.
4. Download the image manually into `public/assets/images/daps-original/`.
5. Name it using lowercase kebab-case.
6. Run `npm run process:images`.
7. Put the generated `.webp` filename in `image_filename`.
8. Run `npm run generate:data`.
9. Check the image in card view, table view, and details view.

Image optimizer:

```bash
npm run process:images
```

The script reads from `public/assets/images/daps-original/`, writes optimized `.webp` files to `public/assets/images/daps/`, resizes to fit within 800px by 800px, preserves aspect ratio, avoids cropping, and uses WebP quality around 82. It does not overwrite existing files unless you pass:

```bash
npm run process:images -- --overwrite
```

## GitHub Pages Deployment

The Vite base path is configured as `/dap-database/`. The included GitHub Actions workflow builds on pushes to `main`, generates JSON from CSV, and deploys `dist` using GitHub Pages Actions. Set the repository Pages source to GitHub Actions.

Production URL: https://jrequiroso.github.io/dap-database/

## Future Plans

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for planned model additions, source rules, variant rules, and scope notes.

Private feature planning is intentionally kept out of the public repository and website.
